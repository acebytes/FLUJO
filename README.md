# DISCLAIMER
====> FLUJO is still an early preview! Expect it to break at some points, but improve rapidly! <====

For *anything* that you struggle with (MCP Installation, Application Issues, Usability Issues, Feedback): **PLEASE LET ME KNOW!**
-> Create a Github Issue or write on Discord (https://discord.gg/bW7amT5j) and I will look into it! Maybe a response will take a day, but I will try to get back to each and every one of you.

Here's a video guiding you through the whole thing - from installation to output! (15min)

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE
FLUJO has currently EXTENSIVE logging enabled by default! This **will expose your encrypted API-Keys to the terminal output!**. Be VERY careful when grabbing videos or streaming and showing the terminal output!

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-green.svg)](package.json)

FLUJO is an open-source platform that bridges the gap between **workflow orchestration**, **Model-Context-Protocol (MCP)**, and **AI tool integration**. It provides a unified interface for managing AI models, MCP servers, and complex workflows - all locally and open-source.

![FLUJO Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/397ef3a5-e4c1-4667-ac74-6fe96f854ff1)

FLUJO is powered by the [PocketFlowFramework](https://the-pocket-world.github.io/Pocket-Flow-Framework/) and built with [CLine](https://github.com/cline/cline) and a lot of LOVE.

- Visual Debugger: Introducing a visual tool to help debug and troubleshoot more effectively.
- MCP Roots Support: Implementing Checkpoints and Restore features within MCP Roots for better control and recovery options.
- MCP Prompts: Enabling users to build custom prompts that fully leverage the capabilities of the MCP server.
- MCP Proxying STDIO<>SSE: Likely utilizing SuperGateway to proxy standard input/output with Server-Sent Events for enhanced communication: Use MCP Servers managed in FLUJo in any other MCP client.
- Enhanced Integrations: Improving compatibility and functionality with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, and Cline.
- Advanced Orchestration: Adding agent-driven orchestration, batch processing, and incorporating features inspired by Pocketflow.
- Online Template Repository: Creating a platform for sharing models, flows, or complete "packages," making it easy to distribute FLUJO flows to others.
